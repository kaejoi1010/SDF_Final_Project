# SDF_Final_Project

The individual final project I came up with is a great oppurtunity for our youth today. 
We offer step-by-step procedures in becoming a successful business man or women.
Requirements that one must meet in order to finish this program and receive their monthly business loan. 
One must maintain a 3.0 Gpa, if below that GPA we will offer an extension and offer extra help where needed,
One must complete all pf the required business courses for the next 1-3 years. Students will also have to volunteer with any organization at least 3 times a year.
We manifest in bettering the youth, protecting them, and guiding them in the right direction. 
My main focus is for everyone to be established and comfortable with their lifetime career decision. 
These business loans will help cover rent, utilities, phone bills, and ensure you ahve internet access at all times.
We personally will pay all the bills for you while you are involved in this program.
Eventually I will take 1 person at a time to discuss their finances and retrieve all the information I need to pay their personal bills while they are involved in this organization. 
This way each student can just focus on school and bettering themselves. 
Students will also receive a monthly allowance to do outdoor activities if they chose or save for theor future business in mind. 
This will be volunteer work for me in hopes of getting my own start up business loan.
As a natural born leader I hope to help other become successful in our wolrd today.
